Zen Class MongoDB Project
 Project Description

This project demonstrates the use of MongoDB to manage a Zen Class program database.
The database contains collections for:

Users – Student details

Topics – Topics taught in the class

Tasks – Tasks assigned for each topic

Mentors – Mentors and their mentee count

Company Drives – Placement drives with appeared students

Codekata – Number of problems solved by users

Attendance – Attendance status of users

The database is created and managed using MongoDB Compass.


How to Show the Data

Since you have already inserted the data in MongoDB Compass, you can:

Open MongoDB Compass → Connect to your database.

Click on any collection (e.g., users, tasks).

The data will be displayed automatically in the Documents tab.

You can take screenshots of each collection to include in your README if needed.

Alternatively, you can run db.collection.find().pretty() in Mongo Shell to show all documents in a collection.
